<h2>Focus!</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Focus is a concentration game that will test the your level of attention and mental effort. Distractions will appear in the form of sounds, images and animations. If you can stay away from these and type quick enough, victory will be achieved!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
You will experience how hard it can get to find a single image between many different moving objects!
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Concentration
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
You will be looking at different images and animations that will automatically move around the screen. The goal of the game is to find the (one) image whose word-image matches and quickly type it so that the timer pauses and the next level begins. For example, there will be a triangle with name “square” moving around, something that you  must ignore. If you see something like a sleepy person with the word  “bed” on it, then you must quickly type “bed” to pause the timer and jump into the next level. Difficulty will be incremented with levels, making it harder for you to concentrate!
